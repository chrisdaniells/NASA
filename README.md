## Built using:
- React
- React Router
- Webpack
- Grunt
- SCSS/BEM
- Jasmine


## To Run Locally:
- run `npm i`
- run `grunt` and `webpack`
- run `npm test` for Jasmine tests

## Things to be improved:
- More tests
- Improve Styling
- Clean up handling of API endpoints. The two media types returned different data sets, making it difficult to cleanly make API calls.
